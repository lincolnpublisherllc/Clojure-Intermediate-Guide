Additional sections (e.g., Introduction, Conclusion): Captured where code was present

Each code snippet is saved as a .clj file, named using this format:

<chapter-number>_<snippet-number>_<hint>.clj


<chapter-number> = two digits (e.g., 01, 02)

<snippet-number> = three digits (001, 002, …)

<hint> = short cleaned version of the snippet’s first line (for easier recognition)

How to Use

Unzip clojure_intermediate_code_by_chapter.zip

Navigate to the chapter folder you want (chapter-03/, etc.)

Open the .clj files in your Clojure editor (REPL, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)

You can run them individually, or copy into your own project structure

Notes

Extraction relied on Clojure syntax patterns like (ns, (defn, (let, threading macros, and ;; comments.

Code blocks inside ``` fences or tables were also included.

Some snippets may be short one-liners or fragments if the book presented them that way.
